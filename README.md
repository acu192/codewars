# My Codewars Solution Collection

### Purpose

I keep everything in `git` repos. (I even have a repo for my resume.) It's nice to be able to revert to any old version, and sometimes it's nice just to see how things have progressed over time. So... everything goes into a `git` repo in my life--even my Codewars solutions.

### How to take the fun out of Codewars

Go ahead and copy my solutions! That's how you can immediately deplete all the fun from Codewars. :P

### Naming Convention

Each directory in this repo is named as follows: `kyu_rank`-`short_kata_name`

That is, first there's an integer denoting the kyu rank of the kata (challenge), followed by a dash, followed by a short name for the kata (challenge).
